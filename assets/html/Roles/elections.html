					<h2>Basics</h2>

						<li>Any current active member of the club is eligible to run for office and members may run for more than one office.</li>
						<li> Offices to be filled are: president, vice president education, vice president membership, vice president public relations, secretary, treasurer and sergeant at arms.</li>
						<li>All positions should be filled, if possible. However, a club must have a minimum of three officers â€“ the president, a vice president, and the secretary/ treasurer. Each of these offices must be held by three different people.</li>
<br>
<h2>Procedure</h2>
<li>Before you begin the election process, briefly explain the major responsibilities of each office. Then explain the election process and proceed with elections.</li>
<li>Accept nominations for the office of president. A member of the previous committee (including the immediate past President) should nominate this person.</li>
<li>Ask for seconding by other members. </li>
<li>Ask for additional nominations for the office of president. If others are nominated, asks for seconding.</li>
<li>Repeat this for other roles.</li>

<li>Club presidents elected for a term of one year may not be re-elected for a successive term. For other roles, re-election is fine. </li>
