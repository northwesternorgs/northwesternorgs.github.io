					<h2>History</h2>
					<p>Toastmasters began as a series of speaking clubs organized by Ralph C. Smedley (photo on the left) during his time working for the YMCA (Young Men's Christian Association) in Bloomington, Illinois, United States.
						Hence, our district (District 30) is called the Founders' District. Ralph C. Smedley died in 1965. In 1970, Toastmasters International admitted its first female member, Helen Blanchard (photo to the right), under the name Homer Blanchard.
						In 1973, Toastmasters began officially admitting women, and in 1985, Helen became Toastmasters' first female international president. For more detailed history, click <a href="https://www.toastmasters.org/About/History">here</a>.
